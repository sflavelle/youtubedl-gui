YouTubeDL-GUI is a simple interface to the youtube-dl Python script, created using AutoHotKey. Most of the GUI was created with SmartGUI Creator 4.0.

This is also a first scripting project intended for use by the public. It will be improved upon as more is learned about the AHK scripting commands.

FEATURES
Only a few basic features are implemented, such as:
* Choosing an output directory
* Filename templates
* "Start Download" launches youtube-dl with the selected parameters

PREREQUISITES
